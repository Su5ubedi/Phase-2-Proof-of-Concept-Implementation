# Phase 2 Proof of Concept Implementation
 
This assignment is about completing phase two of data structure implementation. 

In this implementation, the proof of concept implementation was used to create a dynamic inventory management system that is more efficient in stock management (Dunn, 2014). A number of data structures were used, as discussed below. First, the hash table was used for storing and retrieving the products from the database. It used the product SKU as a key so that there can be an O(1) lookup
